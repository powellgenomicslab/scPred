\title{Predict cell classes from a new dataset using a trained model}
\usage{
scPredict(
  new,
  reference,
  threshold = 0.55,
  max.iter.harmony = 20,
  recompute_alignment = TRUE,
  seed = 66
)
}
\arguments{
\item{new}{A seurat object containing cells to be classified}

\item{reference}{A \code{Seurat} object with trained model(s) using \code{scPred} or an \code{scPred} object}

\item{threshold}{Threshold used for probabilities to classify cells into classes. All cells below 
this threshold value will be labels as "unassigned". In the case of binary classification (two cell tyoes),
a threshold of \code{0.5} will force all cells to be classified to any of the two cell types. For multi-class
classification, if there's no probability higher than the threshold associated to a cell type, this will
be labelled as "unassigned"}

\item{max.iter.harmony}{Maximum number of rounds to run Harmony. One round of Harmony involves one clustering and one correction step.}

\item{recompute_alignment}{Recompute alignment? Useful if \code{scPredict()} has already been run}

\item{seed}{Numeric seed for harmony}
}
\value{
A Seurat object with additional metadata columns with prediction probabilities associated to each class, a \code{prediction} column, 
indicating the classification based on the provided threshold and a \code{generic_class} column without "unassigned" labels. Additionally,
two new reductions are returned: 
\itemize{
\item \code{scpred}: Aligned data using harmony
\item \code{scpred_projection}: Raw projection using reference loadings
}
